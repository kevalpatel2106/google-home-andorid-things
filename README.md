Google Assistant API Sample for Android Things
==============================================

This sample shows how to call the Google Assistant API from Android Things.

It records a spoken request from the connected microphones, sends it to the Google Assistant API and plays back the Assistant's spoken response on the connected speaker.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Studio 2.2+.
- Android Things compatible board.
- If using [AIY Projects Voice Kit][voice-kit]:
    - Android Things Raspberry Pi Dev Preview [3.1 image][dev-preview-download] with I2S enabled.
        - mount the sdcard image

              # replace sdb1 with the sdcard reader device.
              mount -t msdos /dev/sdb1 /mnt/disk

        - edit `config.txt`

              # comment or remove this line:
              # dtoverlay=pwm-2chan-with-clk,pin=18,func=2,pin2=13,func2=4
              #
              # uncomment or add this line:
              dtoverlay=generic-i2s

        - umount the sdcard image

              sync
              umount /mnt/disk
- If using Android Things: supported [microphone][mic] and [speaker][speaker].
    - set `AUDIO_USE_I2S_VOICEHAT_IF_AVAILABLE = false` in `AssistantActivity.java`
- [Google API Console Project][console].

Run the sample
--------------

- Configure the Google API Console Project to use the [Google Assistant API][google-assistant-api-config].
- Download the `client_secret_NNNN.json` file from the [credentials section of the Console][console-credentials].
- Use the [`google-oauthlib-tool`][google-oauthlib-tool] to generate credentials:
```
pip install google-auth-oauthlib[tool]
google-oauthlib-tool --client-secrets client_secret_NNNN.json \
                     --credentials app/src/main/res/raw/credentials.json \
                     --scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/assistant-sdk-prototype \
                     --save
```
- Make sure to set the [Activity Controls][set-activity-controls] for the Google Account using the application.
- On the first install, grant the sample required permissions for audio and internet access:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
adb install -g app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
```
- On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button or on the command line, type:
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.assistant/.AssistantActivity
```
- Try the assistant demo:

  - Press the button: recording starts.
  - Ask a question in the microphone.
  - Release the button: recording stops.
  - The Google Assistant answer should playback on the speaker.
